Instagram feed for beginners
========================

Getting your head around and API, can be a daunting task. Epecially if you have a basic understanding of code. That is why I have created an Instagram feed, that hopefully everyone can use with ease.

Overview
========================

- Custom html styling (Not required)
- Limit the number of entries returned (Maximum 20)
- Caching

Parameters
========================

- Caching time
- Cache file location.
- Image limit

Usage
========================

This feed is reliant on http://followgram.me/, which takes care of that nasty API babble. So the first thing you'll need to do is register with their site and setup your username.

Once you have registered, you'll need to change the username parameter to your selected username. You can also change the html structure and class, should you want to style it to fit your sites design.

Next upload all files to your main directory, and then just include the file whereever you want the feed to show. (<?php include('instagram.php') ?>)

You can also use CSS or Javascript to control the size of the images.


Credits
========================

Initial idea came when I stumbled across this article by Snipplr.

I cleaned up the code and added caching fucntionality.
